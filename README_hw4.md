This repository contains all the documents and images that people need to reproduce the experiments. The Image folder contains all the images that we used to run through Vision API. It also contains the codes regarding what we do with each of the images to produce the texts and report the confidence value for each image. We defined our own variable accuracy as the percentage of correct letters identified by the Vision API. Then, we use the spreadsheet to graph and visualize the outcome. The graphs for comparison of accuracy vs. confidence value and accuracy of levels are included in the folder as well. The colab notebook is also attached for more information about the codes and detailed steps.
