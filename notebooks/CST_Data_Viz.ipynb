        "# Lung Cancer Post-Translational Modification and Gene Expression Regulation\n",
        "Lung cancer is a complex disease that is known to be regulated at the post-translational modification level, e.g. phosphorylation driven by kinases. Our collaborators at [Cell Signaling Technology Incorporated (CST)](https://www.cellsignal.com/) used Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to measure differential phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation in a panel of 42 lung cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous lung tissue. Gene expression data from 37 of these lung cancer cell lines was also independently obtained from the publically available Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [(CCLE)](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home). In this notebook we will analyze PTM and gene expression regulation across these 37 common lung cancer cell lines. This notebook is part of the GitHub repo: [MaayanLab/CST_Lung_Cancer_Viz](https://github.com/MaayanLab/CST_Lung_Cancer_Viz). The post-translational modification (PTM) and gene expression data were pre-processed (normalized, filtered, etc) in the [CST_Data_Processing.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaayanLab/CST_Lung_Cancer_Viz/blob/master/notebooks/CST_Data_Processing.ipynb) notebook. \n",

        "### Lung Cancer Histology\n",
        "The lung cancer cell lines in this joint dataset fall into two histologies: Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is more common than SCLC and refer to all epithelial lung cancers other than SCLC. SCLC is highly malignant and develops metastasis earlier than NSCLC. SCLC is thought to originate from neuroendocrine cells and are known to have neuronal characteristics [Onganer et al. 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2361510/).\n",

Re-running the analysis for the sub-cluster of very highly regulated PTMS/genes (the large cluster in the middle) reveals enrichment for neuronal functions including: neuron projection, axon guidance, and neuron morphology. Enrichment for genes that are up-regulated in disease (using the [Disease Perturbations from GEO Up ](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaayanLab/CST_Lung_Cancer_Viz/blob/master/notebooks/Merged_SCLC_Cluster.ipynb#Gene-Ontology-Biological-Process-2015) library) shows enrichment for neuronal related cancers including: oligodendroglioma, multiple sclerosis, astrocytoma, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Finally, enrichment using the [MGI Mammalian Phenotype](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaayanLab/CST_Lung_Cancer_Viz/blob/master/notebooks/Merged_SCLC_Cluster.ipynb#MGI-Mammalian-Phenotype) library shows enrichment for genes that cause neuronal abnormalities in mice after knockdown including: abnormal neuron morphology, abnormal brain morphology, abnormal spinal cord morphology, and abnormal nervous system. Collectively, these results indicate that the genes/proteins that co-cluster and have high PTM/gene-expression levels in SCLC cell lines have neuronal functions. This agrees with the neuronal characteristics of SCLC cell lines (see [Onganar et al. 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2361510/)).

        "We find that the lung assocaited transcription factor NKX2-1 (which has been used as a biomarker in lung cancer, [Yang et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494024/)) has similar gene expression and arginine methylation levels across lung cancer cell lines and is clustered with a set of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix related proteins (e.g. actin, myosin). This might point to a functionally important role for NKX2-1 regulation of the cytoskeleton and ECM in lung cancer, which has been previously proposed [Yamaguchi et al. 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610813001360).

This broadly agrees with prior knowledge that NSCLC cell lines are known to form adherent monolayers while SCLC cell lines grow in aggregates ([Doyle et al. 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329817/)). Similarly, enrichment results using the KEGG library show enrichment for focal adhesion among other enrichment results including proteoglycans in cancer and neurotrophin signaling.\n",
